This app includes 3 custom smart pickers for Nextcloud:
* ChatGPT-like answers
* Image generation (with DALL·E 2 or LocalAI)
* Whisper dictation

It also implements

* A Translation provider (using OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo)
* A SpeechToText provider (using Whisper)

Instead of connecting to the OpenAI API for these, you can also connect to a self-hosted [LocalAI](https://localai.io) instance.

## Ethical AI Rating
### Rating for Text generation using ChatGPT via OpenAI API: 🔴

Negative:
* the software for training and inference of this model is proprietary, limiting running it locally or training by yourself
* the trained model is not freely available, so the model can not be run on-premises
* the training data is not freely available, limiting the ability of external parties to check and correct for bias or optimise the model's performance and CO2 usage.
